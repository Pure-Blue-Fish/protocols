## Reservoir Capacity

<div style="padding: 12px; background: #e3f2fd; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>Excess water reservoir: 10 cubic meters (= one full tank)</strong></div>

## Full Drain - No Fish

- [ ] Verify no water in excess reservoir
- [ ] Close water inlet valve to tank
- [ ] Close aeration valve to tank
- [ ] Close oxygen flowmeter to tank
- [ ] Raise bottom drain pipe (elbow)
- [ ] Lower water inlet elbow to excess reservoir
- [ ] Open bottom drain valve

## Lower Level to Half - Fish Present

- [ ] Do not stop aeration and oxygenation! *(Iron rule)*
- [ ] Lower water inlet elbow to excess reservoir
- [ ] Remove upper standpipe
- [ ] Verify continuous water flow to reservoir
- [ ] Stay in visual contact with the tank! *(Don't let it drain completely)*
