## Manual Check Schedule

<table class="problem-table">
                <tr><th>Shift</th><th>Times</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Morning</td><td>08:00, 12:00</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Evening</td><td>16:00, 20:00</td></tr>

## Before Testing

- [ ] Get handheld oxygen meter from management station
- [ ] Verify meter shows 100% in air *(Allowed deviation: ±2%)*

## Performing the Test

- [ ] Measure each tank separately
- [ ] Record results *(Don't rely on one tank - each tank is different!)*

## Electrode Reading (every 2 hours)

- [ ] Read data from loggers or control computer
- [ ] Record in table

## Daily Maintenance

- [ ] Clean electrodes
- [ ] Clean nets around protective pipes
- [ ] Compare electrode reading to manual reading

## Problems & Solutions

                <tr><th>Situation</th><th>Action</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Deviation > 0.5 mg/L between manual and electrode</td><td>Report to biologist/manager immediately</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Deviation > 10%</td><td>Report to biologist/manager immediately</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Manual meter not showing 100% in air</td><td>Clean electrode, check calibration</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Low oxygen in tank</td><td>Check oxygenation system, report immediately</td></tr>
