## Critical Values

- [ ] Toxic ammonia (NH3-): 0.01-0.02 ppm = stress
- [ ] Causes burns to epidermis, gills, eyes
- [ ] Can cause death even at low concentrations

## Pool Sampling - Daily

- [ ] Recommended time: noon, after at least 3 feedings *(When ammonia is highest)*
- [ ] Take water sample from outlet of most loaded pool
- [ ] Transfer to laboratory
- [ ] Perform ammonia test per lab protocol
- [ ] Calculate toxic ammonia NH3-
- [ ] Enter into tracking system
- [ ] Report to biologist

## Filter Sampling - Daily

- [ ] Purpose: identify failures before they affect pools
- [ ] Take sample from filter inlet
- [ ] Take sample from filter outlet
- [ ] Test both samples
- [ ] Enter into tracking system
- [ ] Report to biologist
