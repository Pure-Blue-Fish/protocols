## Team Roles

- [ ] Main receiving coordinator
- [ ] Recording and data coordinator
- [ ] Measurements and bag checking coordinator
- [ ] Tank pouring coordinator (on ladder)

## Acclimation Rate Limits

<table class="problem-table">
                <tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Max Change per 30 min</th></tr>
                <tr><td>pH</td><td>Up to 0.3 units</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Temperature</td><td>Up to 2°C</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Salinity</td><td>Up to 3 ppt</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Oxygen</td><td>Minimal! Increase only if < 6 ppm</td></tr>
              </table>

## Step 1: Unloading & Arrangement

- [ ] Unload boxes from truck and arrange in rows
- [ ] Open sample bags (up to 10%)
- [ ] Measure and record arrival parameters
- [ ] Mark bags with high DOA *(Leave these for last!)*

## Step 2: System Preparation

- [ ] Position acclimation tanks near destination tanks
- [ ] Connect submersible pump with hose and valve
- [ ] Ensure aeration/oxygenation is OFF at source tank *(Prevents gas bubble disease)*
- [ ] Insert oxygen diffuser into acclimation tank

## Step 3: Adding Water to Bags

- [ ] Open bags
- [ ] Pour one liter of tank water
- [ ] Wait 10 minutes
- [ ] Pour second liter

## Step 4: Pouring into Acclimation Tank

- [ ] Pass bags to pouring coordinator
- [ ] Pour gently into tank
- [ ] Initial pour: at least 30 liters of bags
- [ ] Add ammonia-absorbing material (per biologist instruction)

## Step 5: The Acclimation

- [ ] Flow system water at slow rate
- [ ] Measure every 30 min: pH, temp, salinity
- [ ] Adjust flow rate according to rate limits
- [ ] Completion: parameters match system + fish behaving normally

## Warning Signs

- [ ] pH rising too fast - slow down water flow
- [ ] Oxygen dropping below 6 - carefully increase oxygenation
- [ ] Fish behaving abnormally - report to biologist immediately
