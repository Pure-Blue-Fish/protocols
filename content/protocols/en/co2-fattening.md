## Manual Measurement - Oxyguard

- [ ] Get Oxyguard device from lab/management station
- [ ] Turn on with electrode out of water
- [ ] Wait one minute
- [ ] Insert electrode into water
- [ ] Wait 5 minutes until stabilized
- [ ] Read value in ppm
- [ ] Rinse electrode in fresh water
- [ ] Dry

## Calculation from pH and Alkalinity

- [ ] Measure pH
- [ ] Measure alkalinity
- [ ] Enter into CO2 calculator in Excel
- [ ] Check Free CO2 value
- [ ] Compare to measurement result
