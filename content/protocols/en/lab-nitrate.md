## Where to Sample?

<table class="problem-table">
                <tr><th>Location</th><th>Test Type</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Fish pool</td><td>Hanna - general nitrate</td></tr>

## Hanna Marine Nitrate High Range

- [ ] Perform dilution with distilled water (preferably 1:4)
- [ ] Turn on checker → C1 will appear
- [ ] Fill cuvette with 10 ml diluted test water
- [ ] Wipe with microfiber cloth
- [ ] Insert into checker and press → C2 will appear
- [ ] Remove, add reagent powder
- [ ] Shake until precipitate disappears
- [ ] Wipe and reinsert
- [ ] Wait 7 minutes
- [ ] Read result *(Result × dilution factor = actual nitrate)*

## Problems & Solutions

<table class="problem-table">
                <tr><th>Situation</th><th>Action</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Nitrate rising</td><td>Check anaerobic filter function</td></tr>
                <tr><td>No difference between inlet and outlet</td><td>Report - poor filter efficiency</td></tr>
                <tr><td>High values</td><td>Report immediately to biologist</td></tr>
